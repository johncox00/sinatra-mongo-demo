sinatra-mongodb-demo
==================

This was a live demo done with Davinci Coders in Louisville, CO on 8-22-12.

You'll need to [install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart).

Then make sure you have 'mongod' running.

You'll need to [install Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/installation.html) as well.

Finally, you'll need to get [Sinatra singing](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro).

Enjoy!
